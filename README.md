# Integrated Reactive Transport Hands-on

This workshop was developed for the IDEAS-Watersheds Phase 2 All Hands.

Facilitators: Sergi Molins (LBNL) and Glenn Hammond (PNNL)

Date: December 9, 2023

Location: Stanford University 

# Learning Objectives

At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* Set up reactive transport simulations in integrated hydrology problems in ATS using test and demonstration examples
* Set up a PFLOTRAN input file
* Address common issues that arise when setting up a new reactive transport problem

# Prerequisites

To maximize the learning experience from the workshop, participants should have be familiar with 
* Integrated hydrology and solute transport
* Aqueous geochemistry
* The use of ATS
* The use of containers on their computers 
* The use of text editors and visualization tools (e.g. Visit, Parflow)

# Outline

* **1. Tracer transport:**  

_Set up an integrated tracer transport problem in a column building on ATS integrated hydrology inputs (Sergi)._

* **2. Geochemical reaction network:**  

_Set up and test a geochemical problem in PFLOTRAN (Glenn)._

* **3. Integrated reactive transport:**

_Set up a reactive transport problem building on the column simulation and PFLOTRAN inputs and troubleshooting (Sergi and Glenn)._

* **4. Integrated reactive transport:**  

_Set up more complex simulations: the hillslope example (Sergi)._
