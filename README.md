# Integrated Reactive Transport Hands-on

This workshop was developed for the IDEAS-Watersheds Phase 2 All Hands.

Facilitators: Sergi Molins (LBNL) and Glenn Hammond (PNNL)
Date: December 9, 2023
Location: Stanford University 

# 1. Learning Objectives

At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* Set up reactive transport simulations in integrated hydrology problems in ATS using test and demonstration examples
* Set up a PFLOTRAN input file
* Address common issues that arise when setting up a new reactive transport problem

# 2. Prerequisites

To maximize the learning experience from the workshop, participants should have be familiar with 
* Integrated hydrology and solute transport
* Aqueous geochemistry
* The use of ATS
* The use of containers on their computers 
* The use of text editors and visualization tools (e.g. Visit, Parflow)
